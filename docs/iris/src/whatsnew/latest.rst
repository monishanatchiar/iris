Features
========

* The :mod:`~iris.fileformats.nimrod` module provides richer meta-data translation
  when loading ``Nimrod`` data into cubes. This covers most known
  operational use-cases.

* Statistical operations :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.collapsed`,
  :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.aggregated_by` and :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.rolling_window`
  previously removed every :class:`iris.coord.CellMeasure` attached to the 
  cube.  Now, a :class:`iris.coord.CellMeasure` will only be removed if it is 
  associated with an axis over which the statistic is being run.

* Supporting ``Iris`` for both ``Python2`` and ``Python3`` resulted in pinning our
  dependency on `matplotlib`_ at ``v2.x``.  Now that ``Python2`` support has
  been dropped, ``Iris`` is free to use the latest version of `matplotlib`_.
 
* `CF Ancillary Data`_ variables are now supported.

* Python `logging`_ is now supported within :mod:`iris.analysis.maths`,
  :mod:`iris.common.lenient`, and :mod:`iris.common.metadata`. Each module
  now defines a :class:`logging.Logger` instance called ``logger``.


Bugs Fixed
==========

* The method :meth:`~iris.Cube.cube.remove_coord` would fail to remove derived
  coordinates, will now remove derived coordinates by removing aux_factories.

* The ``__iter__()`` method in :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` was set to ``None``.
  ``TypeError`` is still raised if a :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` is iterated over
  but ``isinstance(cube, collections.Iterable)`` now behaves as expected.

* Concatenating cubes along an axis shared by cell measures would cause 
  concatenation to inappropriately fail.  These cell measures are now 
  concatenated together in the resulting cube.

* Copying a cube would previously ignore any attached 
  :class:`~iris.coords.CellMeasure`.  These are now copied over.

* A :class:`~iris.coords.CellMeasure` requires a string ``measure`` attribute
  to be defined, which can only have a value of ``area`` or ``volume``. 
  Previously, the ``measure`` was provided as a keyword argument to
  :class:`~iris.coords.CellMeasure` with an default value of ``None``, which 
  caused a ``TypeError`` when no ``measure`` was provided.  The default value
  of ``area`` is now used.


Incompatible Changes
====================

* The method :meth:`~iris.cube.CubeList.extract_strict`, and the ``strict``
  keyword to :meth:`~iris.cube.CubeList.extract` method have been removed, and
  are replaced by the new routines :meth:`~iris.cube.CubeList.extract_cube` and
  :meth:`~iris.cube.CubeList.extract_cubes`.
  The new routines perform the same operation, but in a style more like other
  ``Iris`` functions such as :meth:`~iris.load_cube` and :meth:`~iris.load_cubes`.
  Unlike ``strict`` extraction, the type of return value is now completely
  consistent : :meth:`~iris.cube.CubeList.extract_cube` always returns a
  :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`, and :meth:`~iris.cube.CubeList.extract_cubes`
  always returns an :class:`iris.cube.CubeList` of a length equal to the
  number of constraints.

* The former function ``iris.analysis.coord_comparison`` has been removed.

* The :func:`iris.experimental.equalise_cubes.equalise_attributes` function
  has been moved from the :mod:`iris.experimental` module into the
  :mod:`iris.util` module.  Please use the :func:`iris.util.equalise_attributes`
  function instead.

* The :mod:`iris.experimental.concatenate` module has now been removed. In 
  ``v1.6.0`` the experimental ``concatenate`` functionality was moved to the
  :meth:`iris.cube.CubeList.concatenate` method.  Since then, calling the
  :func:`iris.experimental.concatenate.concatenate` function raised an 
  exception.

* The :func:`iris.analysis.maths.apply_ufunc` keyword argument has changed
  from ``other_cube`` to ``other``, which aligns it with the rest of the
  :mod:`iris.analysis.maths` API.

* The :meth:`iris.analysis.maths.IFunc.__call__` now ignores any surplus ``other``
  keyword argument provided for a ``data_func`` that only requires **one** argument.
  This aligns the behaviour of :meth:`iris.analysis.maths.IFunc.__call__` with
  :func:`~iris.analysis.maths.apply_ufunc`. Previously a ``ValueError`` exception
  was raised.


Deprecations
============

* The deprecated :class:`iris.Future` flags ``cell_date_time_objects``,
  ``netcdf_promote``, ``netcdf_no_unlimited`` and ``clip_latitudes`` have
  been removed.

* :attr:`iris.fileformats.pp.PPField.lbproc` is now an ``int``. The
  deprecated attributes ``flag1``, ``flag2`` etc. have been removed from it.


Documentation
=============

* Moved the :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_oceanography_plot_orca_projection.py`
  from the general part of the gallery to oceanography.

* Updated documentation to use a modern sphinx theme and be served from  
  https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

* Added support for the `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ code 
  formatter.  This is now automatically checked on GitHub PRs, replacing the 
  older, unittest-based "iris.tests.test_coding_standards.TestCodeFormat".
  Black provides automatic code format correction for most IDEs.  See the new 
  developer guide section on :ref:`iris_code_format`.

* Refreshed the :ref:`whats_new_contributions` for the :ref:`iris_whatsnew`.
  This includes always creating the ``latest`` what's new page so it appears
  on the latest documentation at
  https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.  This resolves
  :issue:`2104` and :issue:`3451`.  Also updated the 
  :ref:`iris_development_releases_steps` to follow when making a release.

* Enabled the PDF creation of the documentation on the `Read the Docs`_ service.
  The PDF may be accessed by clicking on the version at the bottom of the side
  bar, then selecting ``PDF`` from the ``Downloads`` section.
